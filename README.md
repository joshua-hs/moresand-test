# Moresand tech test

To run locally, please navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm i`, then `npm start`. Then, open a new terminal and navigate to the `client` directory and run `yarn`, then `yarn start`. I was planning to use docker to simplify local deployment, but I ran into a few issues which were taking a while to figure out. I hope the above approach works.

The UI is pretty barebones, but I presume this was not the primary focus of the test.
